# 1/17/2020
* Attended: Mahanthi/Vinay/Pani/Sudha
* Mahanthi
  * Mahanthi talked about how SciKitLearn has made it simple to make various models.
  * The way you model for Linear Modeling/Extended Linear Modeling/Stochastic Gradient Descent/SVM is similar.
  * Once you fit for a model the approach is the same for all other models.
  * Uploaded the Jupyter notebooks for Chapter 3-9 to GitHub
  * Talked about NPTEL Special Series course [Special Series on Data Science](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/128/106/128106002/)
