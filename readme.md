  * Algorithms: https://www.hebergementwebs.com/article/machine-learning-with-python
* Vinay
  * Nothing much
  * Presented the project from the Python course he took last year - spent 30 mins explaining that
* Mahanthi

* Attended: Mahanthi/Vinay/Pani/Sudha
* Mahanthi
  * Mahanthi talked about how SciKitLearn has made it simple to make various models.
    * The way you model for Linear Modeling/Extended Linear Modeling/Stochastic Gradient Descent/SVM is similar.
    * Once you fit for a model the approach is the same for all other models.
  * Uploaded the Jupyter notebooks for Chapter 3-9 to GitHub
  * Talked about NPTEL Special Series course [ACM Summer School on Data Sciences (Goa 2018)](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/128/106/128106002/)
* Pani
  * Install Jupyter Notebooks
  * Derek Banas
    * in detail watched/did the problems from first 5 videos
  * Tutorials Point
    * Experimented on Chapter 1 
    * Experimented on Chapter 2
  * GitHub - Created Repository for Data Science projects
* Vinay
  * MathTutorDVD.com is interesting
* Sudha
  * watched 2 videos of Derek Banas.
  * She said she will experiment with Anaconda and Jupyter notebook in the coming weeks
